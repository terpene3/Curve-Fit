# Curve-Fit
Implements methods for fitting series of curves using a summation of arbitrary peak shapes and a background 
with the focus on use for time series.

Allows for:

  Fitting
  
  Integration
  
  Plotting
  
  
Integration and model parameters are returned as 2D numpy arrays to allow for facile manipulation of results as a time series.
